[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/sodayo?color=a1b858&label=)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sodayo)

## Introduction
`sodayo` is a state management for React.

This project is inspired by [Pinia](https://github.com/vuejs/pinia) and [Resso](https://github.com/nanxiaobei/resso).

## Installation
```bash
// NPM
$ npm i -S sodayo
// Yarn
$ yarn add sodayo
// PNPM
$ pnpm add sodayo
```

## Docs

### Getting Started
Similar to Pinia, sodayo recommends `src/stores` as a directory for storing the store. You can create this folder first.

### Creating a store

Let's create a new store - how about calling it "app"? (You need to create `app.(js|ts)` under `src/stores`)
Then, we need to initialize it.

```ts
// `src/stores/app.ts`
import { defineStore, useAtom } from "sodayo";

export const useAppStore = () => {
  const useDefine = () => { // See why it's so named below
    const count = useAtom(0);
    const inc = (n = 1) => { count.value += n; };
    return {
      count,
      inc,
    };
  };
  return defineStore(useDefine);
};
```

PS: The reason for using "useXXX" as the name instead of "XXX" is React's limitation on hooks: you can only call another hook in a function that starts with "use".

If you've used Vue and Pinia, this might be familiar. The way to create this Store comes from Pinia. And `useAtom` is a utility hook that behaves like  `ref` in `@vue/reactivity`. In `defineStore`, you can create functions to make changes to the `value` properties of these atoms, just as `inc` does. We call these functions "mutations".

### Using a store in the component

In a component, you can do like this to access to the store.

```tsx
// `src/pages/some-page.tsx`
import { useAppStore } from "../stores/app.ts";

function Page() {
  const store = useAppStore();

  return (
    <div>
      {store.count}
      <button type="button" onClick={() => store.inc()}>
        Add 1
      </button>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => store.inc(10)}>
        Add 10
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

You might be confused - where is the `value property of count`? In fact, sodayo hAS a layer internally so that you don't have to annoy and type `.value` in your code every time. 

PS: You can't modify the count in the component, you can only modify it through the mutation defined in the store. Because the top-level Proxy does not implement the modification operation on the value.

That's it! You already understand how to use sodayo. Go and develop your project!

### Advanced

#### Getters

Getter atoms are supported since v0.2.0. You can use it like this:
```ts
import { defineStore, useAtom } from "sodayo";

export const useAppStore = () => {
  const useDefine = () => {
    const count = useAtom(0);
    const doubled = useAtom(() => count.value * 2);
    const inc = (n = 1) => { count.value += n; };
    return {
      count,
      doubled,
      inc,
    };
  };
  return defineStore(useDefine);
};
````
After that, you can use it like a normal atom.
